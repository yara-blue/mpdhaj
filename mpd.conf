# An example configuration file for MPD
# See the mpd.conf man page for a more detailed description of each parameter.


# Files and directories #######################################################
#
# This setting controls the top directory which MPD will search to discover the
# available audio files and add them to the daemon's online database. This 
# setting defaults to the XDG directory, otherwise the music directory will be
# be disabled and audio files will only be accepted over ipc socket (using
# file:// protocol) or streaming files over an accepted protocol.
#
music_directory		"/home/yara/Music"
port "6602"
#
# This setting sets the MPD internal playlist directory. The purpose of this
# directory is storage for playlists created by MPD. The server will use 
# playlist files not created by the server but only if they are in the MPD
# format. This setting defaults to playlist saving being disabled.
#
playlist_directory "/home/yara/Music/playlists_yara"
#
# This setting sets the location of the MPD database. This file is used to
# load the database at server start up and store the database while the 
# server is not up. This setting defaults to disabled which will allow
# MPD to accept files over ipc socket (using file:// protocol) or streaming
# files over an accepted protocol.
#
db_file "/tmp/mpd.db"
# 
# These settings are the locations for the daemon log files for the daemon.
# These logs are great for troubleshooting, depending on your log_level
# settings.
#
# The special value "syslog" makes MPD use the local syslog daemon. This
# setting defaults to logging to syslog, otherwise logging is disabled.
#
log_file "/tmp/mpd.log"
#
# This setting sets the location of the file which stores the process ID
# for use of mpd --kill and some init scripts. This setting is disabled by
# default and the pid file will not be stored.
#
pid_file "/tmp/mpd.pid"
#
# This setting sets the location of the file which contains information about
# most variables to get MPD back into the same general shape it was in before
# it was brought down. This setting is disabled by default and the server 
# state will be reset on server start up.
#
state_file "/tmp/mpdstate"
#
# The location of the sticker database.  This is a database which
# manages dynamic information attached to songs.
#
#sticker_file			"~/.mpd/sticker.sql"

# Audio Output ################################################################
#
# MPD supports various audio output types, as well as playing through multiple 
# audio outputs at the same time, through multiple audio_output settings 
# blocks. Setting this block is optional, though the server will only attempt
# autodetection for one sound card.
#
# See <http://mpd.wikia.com/wiki/Configuration#Audio_Outputs> for examples of 
# other audio outputs.
#
# An example of an ALSA output:
#
audio_output {
	type		"alsa"
	name		"My ALSA Device"
##	device		"hw:0,0"	# optional
##	format		"44100:16:2"	# optional
##	mixer_type      "hardware"	# optional
##	mixer_device	"default"	# optional
##	mixer_control	"PCM"		# optional
##	mixer_index	"0"		# optional
}

#
# An example of an OSS output:
#
#audio_output {
#	type		"oss"
#	name		"My OSS Device"
##	device		"/dev/dsp"	# optional

##	mixer_type      "hardware"	# optional
##	mixer_device	"/dev/mixer"	# optional
##	mixer_control	"PCM"		# optional
#}
#
# An example of a shout output (for streaming to Icecast):
#
#audio_output {
#	type		"shout"

#	host		"localhost"
#	port		"8000"
#	mount		"/mpd.ogg"
#	password	"hackme"

##	description	"My Stream Description"	# optional
##	genre		"jazz"			# optional
##	public		"no"			# optional
##	timeout		"2"			# optional
##	mixer_type      "software"		# optional

# An example of a recorder output:
#
#audio_output {
#	type		"recorder"
#	name		"My recorder"
#	encoder		"vorbis"		# optional, vorbis or lame
#	path		"/var/lib/mpd/recorder/mpd.ogg"
##	quality		"5.0"			# do not define if bitrate is defined
#	bitrate		"128"			# do not define if quality is defined
#	format		"44100:16:1"
#}
#
#
# An example of a pulseaudio output (streaming to a remote pulseaudio server)

##	sink		"remote_server_sink"	# optional
#}
#
## Example "pipe" output:
#
#audio_output {
#	type		"pipe"
#	name		"my pipe"
#	command		"aplay -f cd 2>/dev/null"
## Or if you're want to use AudioCompress
#	command		"AudioCompress -m | aplay -f cd 2>/dev/null"
## Or to send raw PCM stream through PCM:
#	command		"nc example.org 8765"
#	format		"44100:16:2"
#}
#
## An example of a null output (for no audio output):
#
#audio_output {
#	type		"null"
#	name		"My Null Output"
#	mixer_type      "none"			# optional
#}
#
# This setting will change all decoded audio to be converted to the specified
# format before being passed to the audio outputs. By default, this setting is
# disabled.
#
#audio_output_format		"44100:16:2"
#
# If MPD has been compiled with libsamplerate support, this setting specifies
